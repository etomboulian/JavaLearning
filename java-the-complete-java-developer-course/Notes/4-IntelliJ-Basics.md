### if-then statement

- It tells your program to execute a certain section of code, only if a particular test evaluates to true
- This is called conditional logic.

```if then statement example
boolean isAlien = false;
if (isAlien == false)
    System.out.println("It is not an alien!");
```

#### Assignment Operator (=)

- The assignment operator assigns the value of an expression to the variable to the left of the operator
- `boolean isAlien = false;` So isAlien is the variable in this case and it is set to false

#### Equality Operator (==)

- The equality operator tests to see if two operatnds are considered equal and returns a boolean value
  `if (isAlien == false) {`
- Here isAlient is being tested against the value false

#### The code block

- A Code block allows mroe than one statement to be executed
- example: `if (expression) {// here is the code block}`
- Though single line if statements don't require a code block, it is good practice to use them always.

#### Logical AND Operator

#### Logical OR Operator

#### Logical NOT Operator

#### Ternary Operator

- Java officially calls this the conditional operator
- Takes 3 operands `operand1 ? operand2 : operand3`
- If operand 1 is true then return operand 2 otherwise return operand 3;
